The purpose of establishing this association arose from the need for a more constructive connection between institutions of higher education, cultural institutions, primary and secondary schools, with the aim of enabling more thorough research and practical work of students and young artists in the field of contemporary visual creativity, with the intention of encouraging generational professional networking, as well as practical mastery of the methodology of educational and pedagogical practice.</p>
			<p>The main goals of the association are the promotion and development of cultural and artistic activities of national, regional and international importance. The promotion of young artists in the field of visual arts is carried out through various projects and the provision of opportunities for the organisation of film and theatre projects, exhibitions, publication of dramatic texts, various professional workshops, festivals and performances. In this way, the development of local communities and the connection of different sectors within each community is encouraged, which further contributes to the development of the entire cultural environment.</p>
			<p>The first projects produced by the Center for Visual Arts in cooperation with the Academy of Arts in Banja Luka are PAF (Theatrical Academic Festival) and Interakcija. These projects have already received the support of the City of Banja Luka, the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Srpska and the Ministry of Civil Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The institutions that supported these projects are the National Theater of the Republic of Srpska, \"Jazavac\" City Theatre, the Children's Theater of the Republic of Srpska, the Museum of Contemporary Art of the Republic of Srpska, Banski Dvor - Cultural Centre, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Belgrade, the Belgrade Youth Center and the House of Legates in Belgrade. Academies and faculties that have connected with these projects are leading higher education institutions at the state and regional level.</p>",
